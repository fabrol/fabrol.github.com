This was a project motivated by a lack of free pomodoro apps that were web accessible and not paid. I wanted something simple that just worked.

However, I ended up getting completely nerdsniped into the joys of custom animation. The goal became making tomatoes and ZZZs slowly fill up the screen, one row at a time, satisfying even the most OCD user's desires. 

This was also my first time using Framer Motion, and it was a pleasure to work with. Sometimes the best projects start with a simple need but evolve into something more fun along the way.
