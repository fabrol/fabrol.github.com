I'm a heavy user of erstwhile Wunderlist, which became Microsoft To-Do. I've been using it on and off for 10 years (mostly 2013-16 and then again starting 2022). I love the simplicity of a simple task list which goes into a backlog for quickly adding things.

The one thing I find missing is a historical view of tasks over time. Once a task is complete, it goes into the abyss.

So I built a way to visualize your past tasks over time windows aggregated up to a year. I find it very interesting to look back at my more productive months, reflect on what was going on in life, and draw inspiration: aka summer is not very productive :P
