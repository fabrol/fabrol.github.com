*"What I cannot create, I do not understand."* â€” Richard P. Feynman

In an age of AI-generated code and bloated web frameworks, I took inspiration from [digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) and chose to do it the old fashioned way. Rather than reaching for the usual frameworks or libraries, Iâ€™m hand rolling it from the ground up.

Is it novel? *No.*

Is it theraputic? *Yes.*

A kind of catharsis for those of us who cut our teeth in the pre-AI, hand-crafted web era. To resist the capitalist-work-urge to only do something if its "novel" or "improves something".

I started with a landing page. Then build injection to share components. Then a blog engine..on and on. Each step added a layer of depth to the site, making it feel more interconnected. And while frameworks might have made some of these features easier, building them myself was quite satisfying ðŸ˜Œ

### The Build System

At the heart of the site is a custom build system written in [Deno](https://deno.land/). Itâ€™s inspired by static site generators but keeps things simple and focused, much like the rest of the project.

#### Page Composition

The siteâ€™s structure is modular, using templates to assemble pages from reusable components. The build system (found in `scripts/build.ts`) handles tasks like:

- Loading and merging HTML templates
- Injecting shared elements like navigation and footers
- Processing markdown files for blog posts
- Copying and optimizing assets

Each page has a clean, predictable layout:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!-- Injected head component -->
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <!-- Injected navigation -->
    <main>
      <!-- Page content -->
    </main>
    <!-- Injected footer -->
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

#### The Blog Engine
Itâ€™s simple, but it gets the job done and has room to grow. Features include:

- Frontmatter for metadata
- Automatic slug generation
- Date-based sorting
- Relationships to related projects
- Social media sharing links

Hereâ€™s an example of a markdown post with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "My Post Title"
date: '2024-12-20'
draft: false
slug: my-post
projectSlug: related-project
socialLinks:
  twitter: https://twitter.com/...
---
```

The build system parses these files, converts them to HTML, and slots them into the siteâ€™s templates. Simple and satisfying.

#### Development Workflow

I wanted the development experience to feel frictionless. Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s included:

- A watch system for automatic rebuilds during development
- A CLI task to create new blog posts
- Local file serving for quick testing
- GitHub Actions for automated deployment

For example, creating a new blog post is as simple as:

```bash
deno task new-thought "My New Post Title"
```
The site is hosted on GitHub Pages with a custom GitHub Action workflow .

### Browse and Explore

Itâ€™s fun to dig into the details of how things work, and this site is built with that curiosity in mind. Everything here is simple and openâ€”a nod to the joy of creating systems from scratch. Please browse away, and enjoy exploring how it all comes together.
