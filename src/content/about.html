<div class="about-me">
    <p>I grew up in Delhi, went to a small liberal arts school in New Jersey, and have spent the last decade living between San Francisco and Brooklyn, both of which I love dearly.</p>
    
    <p>I care about reducing inequity in access to essential needs and increasing human agency over our lives.</p>
    
    <p>I thrive at the intersection of user problems and technical complexity. I love building systems, taxonomies and narratives that bridge complexity and make things useful to people.</p>
    
    <p>I started out doing field work at UNICEF in Madagascar, building remote sensing systems for health monitoring.</p>
    
    <p></p>Quickly, I felt a pull to learn more and ended up joining a small startup called Pure Storage, where I ended up staying for 6 years. From early days through IPO, i got a chance to build at different scales, from hands on building distributed databases with 99.9999% uptime, to leading an ML SaaS optimization tool from inception through industry leadership.</p>
    
    <p>Once I had my green card, I took my learnings on how to build, and tried to align *what* i build more closely with my values.</p>
    
    <p></p>It was mid pandemic, and I found an opportunity to lead the Public Health teams at Meta. It was a whirlwind working with governments all over the world, across FB, IG and WA; and deep algorithmic tech, to reach our goal of connecting 50M people with the vaccine. It made me learn reflect deeply on the role of algorithms in public life.</p>

    <p>After Meta, I took a sabbatical, the first since undergrad, to taste freedom post-green card. I spent time writing op-eds on AI and social media policy, exploring how technology can, and should, serve society in fairer ways.</p>
    
    <p>It’s an exploration I’m still on, especially in my current work around increasing user agency over their data and how AI can support critical needs like healthcare, communication, and access to information.</p>
